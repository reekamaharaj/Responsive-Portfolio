            <p><br>Hiya. My name is Reeka. I love to learn new things and can often find myself falling into endless rabbit holes looking things up about... well everything. I am a former civil engineer and am excited to shift career towards software development, specifically into web dev. I attempted to self learn for a few years but found myself not being consistent enough when it came to practice and learning. SO, I decided to enroll in a full stack boot camp :D! Finally I have something to keep me on track. Woohoo! </p>
            
            <p>While I am currently unemployed I keep myself busy with volunteer work. I love cats and work with a few cat rescue groups. I help with transporting cats from one rescue to another, fostering and all my friends know that if they have a cat questions or need help with a cat they found, I am a good first contact. Last year I helped out with 40 cats! I hope to help at least 50 this year, which seems to be easy since by the end of Jan 2020 I helped with 10 cats :) <i class="fas fa-cat"></i></p>
            
            <p>I also work with a few mental health non-profit organizations. Destigmatizing mental health is a really important thing for me. I live with mental illness myself and try to be as open as possible about it, because it is no differnt than any other illness that I live with. </p>

            <p>Other things about me. I enjoy to draw and have a small art business <a href="http://www.doodlejutsu.com" id="weblink">Doodlejutsu</a>. Along with my mental health advocacy I run a blog called <a href="http://www.illgetthere.com" id="weblink">I'll Get There</a> where I write honestly about living with mental illness. Oh and I love music and have been making a point to going to see artists live whenever I can. </p>
