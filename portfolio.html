        <p class="leading-relaxed pb-5"><br>Hiya. My name is Reeka. I love to learn new things and can often find myself falling into endless rabbit
            holes looking things up about... well everything. I am a former civil engineer and am excited to shift
            career towards software development, specifically into web dev. I attempted to self learn for a few years
            but found myself not being consistent enough when it came to practice and learning. SO, I decided to enroll
            in a full stack boot camp :D! Finally I have something to keep me on track. Woohoo! </p>

        <p class="leading-relaxed pb-5">While I am currently unemployed I keep myself busy with volunteer work. I love cats and work with a few cat
            rescue groups. I help with transporting cats from one rescue to another, fostering and all my friends know
            that if they have a cat questions or need help with a cat they found, I am a good first contact. Last year I
            helped out with 40 cats! I hope to help at least 50 this year, which seems to be easy since by the end of
            Jan 2020 I helped with 10 cats :) <i class="fas fa-cat"></i></p>

        <p class="leading-relaxed pb-5">I also work with a few mental health non-profit organizations. Destigmatizing mental health is a really
            important thing for me. I live with mental illness myself and try to be as open as possible about it,
            because it is no differnt than any other illness that I live with. </p>

        <p class="leading-relaxed pb-5">Other things about me. I enjoy to draw and have a small art business <a href="http://www.doodlejutsu.com"
                id="weblink" class="font-bold">Doodlejutsu</a>. Along with my mental health advocacy I run a blog called <a
                href="http://www.illgetthere.com" id="weblink" class="font-bold">I'll Get There</a> where I write honestly about living
            with mental illness. Oh and I love music and have been making a point to going to see artists live whenever
            I can. </p>
